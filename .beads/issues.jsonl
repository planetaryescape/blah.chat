{"id":"blah.chat-q1y","title":"Bidirectional model seed file for Claude + UI model management","description":"## Problem\n\nWith the new UI-based model management, Claude can no longer add models by editing code files. Previously:\n- Models defined in `packages/ai/src/models.ts`\n- Claude edits file → model added\n- Simple, versioned, reviewable\n\nNow:\n- Models managed via Admin UI → stored in Convex DB\n- Claude can't interact with UI\n- User must manually add models\n\n## Solution: CLI Command for Model Management\n\nSimple CLI script that Claude can run to add/update models directly in the database.\n\n```bash\n# Add a new model\nbun run model:add --id \"openai:gpt-6\" --name \"GPT-6\" --provider \"openai\" \\\n  --context 128000 --input 2.5 --output 10\n\n# Or with JSON for complex config\nbun run model:add --json '{\"modelId\": \"openai:gpt-6\", \"name\": \"GPT-6\", ...}'\n```\n\n### Why This Approach\n\n| Aspect | CLI Command | Bidirectional Sync |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Implementation | ~50 lines | Complex sync logic |\n| Time to add model | Seconds | PR → merge → deploy |\n| Complexity | Minimal | High (conflict resolution, formatting) |\n| Fits current arch | Yes (DB is source of truth) | Fighting against it |\n\n### \"But no PR review?\"\n\n- Models are config, not security-critical code\n- Bad model = doesn't work or wrong pricing → fix via UI\n- `modelHistory` table provides full audit trail\n- Can always add models via seed.ts for bulk/reviewed changes\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Phase 1: Core CLI Script\n\n**File:** `scripts/model-cli.ts`\n\n```typescript\n#!/usr/bin/env bun\nimport { ConvexHttpClient } from \"convex/browser\";\nimport { api } from \"@blah-chat/backend/convex/_generated/api\";\nimport { parseArgs } from \"util\";\n\nconst client = new ConvexHttpClient(process.env.CONVEX_URL!);\n\nconst { values, positionals } = parseArgs({\n  args: process.argv.slice(2),\n  options: {\n    id: { type: \"string\" },\n    name: { type: \"string\" },\n    provider: { type: \"string\" },\n    context: { type: \"string\" },\n    input: { type: \"string\" },  // cost per million\n    output: { type: \"string\" }, // cost per million\n    json: { type: \"string\" },   // full config as JSON\n    // ... other fields\n  },\n  allowPositionals: true,\n});\n\nconst command = positionals[0]; // add, update, list, deprecate\n\nasync function main() {\n  switch (command) {\n    case \"add\":\n      const model = values.json \n        ?
