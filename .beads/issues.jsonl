{"id":"blah.chat-q1y","title":"Bidirectional model seed file for Claude + UI model management","description":"## Problem\n\nWith the new UI-based model management, Claude can no longer add models by editing code files. Previously:\n- Models defined in `packages/ai/src/models.ts`\n- Claude edits file → model added\n- Simple, versioned, reviewable\n\nNow:\n- Models managed via Admin UI → stored in Convex DB\n- Claude can't interact with UI\n- User must manually add models or describe to Claude who can't act on it\n\n## Proposed Solution: Bidirectional Seed Sync\n\nMake `packages/backend/convex/models/seed.ts` bidirectional and idempotent:\n\n### 1. **Seed → DB** (already partially works)\n- Read `SEED_MODELS` array from seed file\n- Insert models not already in DB (by modelId)\n- Update existing models if seed has newer data (optional flag)\n\n### 2. **DB → Seed** (new capability needed)\n- Query all models from DB\n- Export to seed file format\n- Only add models that exist in DB but not in seed\n- Preserve manual edits/formatting in seed file\n\n### Workflow After Implementation\n\n**Claude adds model:**\n1. Claude edits `seed.ts`, adds new model to `SEED_MODELS`\n2. PR reviewed, merged\n3. Run `bunx convex run models/seed:seedModels` (or auto on deploy)\n4. New model appears in DB and UI\n\n**User adds model via UI:**\n1. User creates model in Admin \u003e Models\n2. Model saved to DB immediately (works today)\n3. Run `bunx convex run models/seed:exportToSeed` (new)\n4. Seed file updated with new model\n5. Commit change to preserve in version control\n\n**Sync command (both directions):**\n```bash\nbunx convex run models/seed:syncModels\n# 1. Imports seed → DB (new models only)\n# 2. Exports DB → seed (new models only)\n# Idempotent: running multiple times = same result\n```\n\n## Key Files\n\n| File | Current Purpose | Changes Needed |\n|------|-----------------|----------------|\n| `packages/backend/convex/models/seed.ts` | One-way seed (code→DB) | Add export/sync functions |\n| `packages/ai/src/models.ts` | Static MODEL_CONFIG | Consider if seed.ts should be source of truth |\n| `packages/backend/convex/models/queries.ts` | DB queries | May need `listForExport()` query |\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n1. **File writing from Convex**: Convex actions can't write to filesystem directly. Options:\n   - CLI script that queries DB then writes file (recommended)\n   - API endpoint that returns seed file content for manual paste\n   - Git hook that auto-syncs on commit\n\n2. **Conflict resolution**: If same modelId exists in both with different data:\n   - Option A: DB wins (UI is authoritative for runtime)\n   - Option B: Seed wins (code is authoritative for deploys)\n   - Option C: Merge with timestamp (newer wins)\n   - Recommendation: DB wins for export, seed wins for import\n\n3. **Idempotency**: \n   - Use modelId as unique key\n   - Check existence before insert\n   - Compare checksums before update\n   - Running sync N times = same result as running once\n\n4. **Formatting preservation**:\n   - Export should match existing seed file style\n   - Use AST manipulation or template literals\n   - Group by provider, alphabetize within groups\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### Phase 1: CLI Export Script\n```typescript\n// scripts/export-models.ts\nconst models = await convex.query(api.models.queries.listForExport);\nconst seedContent = generateSeedFile(models);\nawait fs.writeFile('packages/backend/convex/models/seed.ts', seedContent);\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Make Import Idempotent\n```typescript\n// seed.ts\nexport const syncModels = internalMutation({\n  handler: async (ctx) =\u003e {\n    const existing = await ctx.db.query(\"models\").collect();\n    const existingIds = new Set(existing.map(m =\u003e m.modelId));\n    \n    for (const model of SEED_MODELS) {\n      if (!existingIds.has(model.modelId)) {\n        await ctx.db.insert(\"models\", model);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Unified Sync Command\n```bash\nbun run sync-models\n# 1. Pull: convex query → update seed.ts\n# 2. Push: seed.ts → convex mutation\n# Reports: \"Added 2 from DB, pushed 1 to DB, 47 unchanged\"\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Claude can add model by editing seed.ts, running sync adds to DB\n- [ ] User can add model via UI, running sync updates seed.ts\n- [ ] Running sync multiple times produces same result (idempotent)\n- [ ] No data loss - both sources preserved\n- [ ] Clear CLI command: `bun run sync-models`\n- [ ] Works in CI/CD pipeline\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should seed.ts replace packages/ai/src/models.ts as source of truth?\n2. Auto-sync on deploy or manual only?\n3. How to handle model deletions (soft delete in DB, remove from seed)?\n4. Should profiles and router config also sync bidirectionally?","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"bhekanik@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T17:18:07.808034Z","created_by":"Bhekani Khumalo","updated_at":"2026-01-27T17:18:07.808034Z"}
