# Key Features of blah.chat

This document outlines the core features that differentiate blah.chat from other AI assistants. These points should be highlighted in marketing copy, system prompts, and user onboarding.

## 1. Universal Model Access
**"All models, one place."**
Access models from every major provider without jumping between apps. Whether you need OpenAI's reasoning (o1), Anthropic's nuance (Claude), Google's long context (Gemini), or Perplexity's search, it's all here.

## 2. Mid-Chat Model Switching
**"The right model for every turn."**
Switch models instantly in the middle of a conversation. Start with a fast model for brainstorming, switch to a reasoning model for complex logic, and finish with a creative model for polishing—all in one thread.

## 3. Conversation Branching
**"Explore every possibility."**
Never lose a good train of thought. Branch your chat at any point to explore a different direction while keeping the original history intact. Perfect for "what if" scenarios or testing different approaches.

## 4. Message Bookmarking
**"Never lose a gem."**
Bookmark specific messages to save them for later. Build a personal library of prompts, code snippets, and insights that you can jump back to instantly from your bookmarks collection.

## 5. Notes & Sharing
**"Turn chat into creation."**
Convert any message into a Note to edit, extend, and refine it. Share your notes publicly or keeping them private. It's the bridge between chatting and doing.

## 6. Hybrid Search
**"Find anything, instantly."**
Our search combines semantic understanding (vector search) with keyword precision. Whether you remember the exact phrase or just the concept, you'll find that one conversation from three months ago across all projects.

## 7. Unlimited Projects
**"Organize your way."**
Create as many projects as you need. Group conversations by topic, work stream, or hobby. Keep your AI interactions as organized as your work.

## 8. Transparent Cost Tracking
**"Know exactly what you pay."**
We believe in total transparency. See the exact token usage and cost for every single message. Monitor your spending with detailed statistics so there are never any surprises at the end of the month.
