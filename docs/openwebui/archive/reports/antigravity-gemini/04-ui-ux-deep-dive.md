# Research Report: Open WebUI UI/UX Deep Dive

## 1. Context & Purpose
This document dissects the *visual mechanics* and *interaction design* of **Open WebUI**. The goal is to isolate the specific UI details (animations, timings, feedback loops) that make the application feel "polished" and "responsive."

## 2. The "Feel" of the Chat
Open WebUI aims for a **utilitarian but polished** aesthetic, similar to "Developer Tools" (VS Code) rather than "Consumer Social Apps".

### Message Sending Physics
*   **Mechanism**: "Push Up" (Natural DOM Flow).
*   **Animation**:
    *   **Entrance**: No exaggerated "slide-in" or "pop". It feels instant because it *is* instant (optimistic update).
    *   **Text Appearance**: Fade-in `transition:fade={{ duration: 100 }}` is applied to *markdown tokens* to smooth out rendering jitter.
    *   **Observation**: It relies on the browser's native layout engine to "shove" content up. This feels fast and responsive.

### Streaming Feedback
*   **The "Thinking" Gap**:
    *   Shows a **Skeleton Loader** immediately after the user sends a message, occupying the space where the answer will be.
    *   This reduces layout shift—the eye is already looking at the "answer zone".
*   **The "Streaming" Cursor**:
    *   A blinking block cursor (`▍`) or vertical bar is appended to the stream.
    *   **Why it works**: It mimics human typing or a terminal output, fitting the "AI as a tool" mental model. It gives reassurance that the connection is alive.
    *   **Implementation**: A blinking CSS animation (`animate-pulse`) on a generic `<span>`.

## 3. Input Area: The Command Center
The Input box is the crown jewel of Open WebUI's UX. It is not just a text area; it is a **Platform**.

*   **Auto-Expansion**: Smoothly grows to ~30-40% of viewport height before scrolling.
*   **Commands (`/`)**: Typing `/` triggers a popover menu (like Slack or Discord).
*   **Mentions (`#` or `@`)**: Allows referencing specific models or existing files.
*   **Multi-Modal**: Drag-and-drop support for images and documents is highlighted with a dashed border overlay.

## 4. Mobile Polish
*   **Viewport Units**: Uses `dvh` (Dynamic Viewport Height) to handle the mobile browser address bar dance.
*   **Bottom Sheet**: On mobile, the "Sidebar" becomes a "Bottom Sheet" or "Slide-over" menu, keeping the thumb in the "action zone" (bottom of screen).
*   **Input Protection**: Special care is visible in the usage of `safe-area-inset-bottom` to prevent the home bar from overlapping the input.

## 5. Summary Findings
Open WebUI feels "Pro" because of:
1.  **Input Capabilities**: The user feels powerful in the input box.
2.  **Cursor feedback**: The app feels "alive" during generation.
3.  **Layout Stability**: Skeletons prevent jarring jumps.

It does **not** rely on fancy motion graphics or heavy animations, which keeps it feeling lightweight and fast.
